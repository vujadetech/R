```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
options(digits=3) # ...lest we over-fit
library(purrr);  library(RSQLite); #library(comprehenr)
library(kernlab); library(zeallot);
library(rlist)
```

## Question 2.2.1: Find classifier using ksvm.

The C value that I eventually settled on was 0.0014, which had a success rate of 0.867 = 86.7%. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r}
map(1:3, function(x) x*x) %>% unlist
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
